# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Note: To run this project in your Local Machine You need to have NodeJs

if you dont want to install NodeJs I Deployed the App on GitHub Pages so you can test it and don't bother yourself 
with running it locally and using the terminal to execute some script like npm install

the URL for it is https://mazen103501.github.io/movie-search-app/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

After cloning the project into you Local Machine and installing NodeJs on it

go to the cloned repository and open the terminal in it then write 

npm install or npm i (the same thing) 

you should wait for little bit of time so it installs the dependencies


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
